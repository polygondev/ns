        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
        The Republic of Warfburg, commonly known as Warfburg, is a country in Gael, The Western Isles. It shares maritime borders with Ainslie and Razzgriz. Warfburg covers an area of 233,748 km2 with a population of 345 million.<br>
        While Warfburg was discovered by the Merenesians in the 9th century, the first permanent settlement was founded by the Ahnslen on December 16th 1847 near present day Kingston. In 1856, western Warfburg was colonised by the Baumish. Due to damaged records, the exact date is unknown, but assumed to be in early June. The first settlement in East Warfburg (At the time known as Illya na Rotina) was founded on Edefolk island. East Warfburg gained independence on December 31st 1883, though retained close ties to Ainslie. On January 1st 1900 the Baumish Government signed the Hawkingwood Agreement, which allowed Illya na Rotina to succeed from Baumes, and join the Republic of Warfburg. People with Baumish ancestry still make up the majority of people in the Trentwood Islands.<br>
        Warfburg is a Federal Democracy and Parliamentary Republic.<br>
        The Warfburgian economy is defined by capitalism and is considered highly developed, with a GDP of​​ $700,000,000,000.<br>
        Warfburg usually stays relatively peaceful with other nations in the Western Isles, and hence has a relatively small military. Warfburg is a member of the Isles Civil Air Transport Authority, dedicated to keeping civil aviation safe, comfortable, reliable and accessible to everyone. Warfburg is also a member of the East Gael Emergency Management Mechanism, an intergovernmental organisation dedicated to emergency management and disaster responses.
